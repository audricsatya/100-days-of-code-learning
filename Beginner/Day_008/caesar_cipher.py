# Caesar Cipher Project
# The Caesar Cipher is one of the earliest and simplest methods of encryption technique.
# Itâ€™s simply a type of substitution cipher, i.e., each letter of a given text is replaced by a letter with a fixed number of positions down the alphabet.

# For example with a shift of 1, A would be replaced by B, B would become C, and so on.
alphabet = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n', 'o', 'p', 'q', 'r', 's', 't', 'u', 'v', 'w', 'x', 'y', 'z']

# The number of positions down the alphabet is called the "shift".
# For example, with a shift of 1, A would be replaced by B, B would become C, and so on.
