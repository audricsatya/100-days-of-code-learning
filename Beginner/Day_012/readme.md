# Day 12

## Overview
On Day 12, the focus is on building a capstone project: a number guessing game.

## Topics Covered
- Random number generation
- User input handling
- Conditional statements
- Loops

## Challenges
- Built a number guessing game where the user tries to guess a randomly generated number within a specific range.
- Implemented logic to provide feedback if the guess is too high or too low.
- Added functionality to track the number of attempts.

## Key Takeaways
- Learned how to generate random numbers using the `random` module.
- Improved understanding of handling user input and validating it.
- Practiced using loops and conditionals to control program flow.

## Notes
- Consider adding enhancements like difficulty levels or a replay option for future iterations.
- Debugging and testing were crucial to ensure the game worked as expected.
- This project helped solidify foundational programming concepts.
