# Day 11 - Blackjack Capstone Project

## Overview
On Day 11, the focus is on building a capstone project: a simplified version of the Blackjack game. This project consolidates Python programming concepts learned so far, including loops, conditionals, functions, and data structures.

## Concepts Practiced
- Using loops and conditionals to control game flow.
- Writing reusable functions.
- Managing game state with variables and lists.
- Implementing basic game logic.

## Project Description
The Blackjack game allows a user to play against the computer. The goal is to get as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it. The game includes:
- Dealing cards to the player and the dealer.
- Calculating scores based on card values.
- Allowing the player to "hit" or "stand."
- Determining the winner based on the final scores.

## Key Learnings
- How to break down a problem into smaller, manageable functions.
- Handling edge cases in game logic.
- Improving code readability and maintainability.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the `Day_011` folder.
3. Run the `blackjack.py` file using Python.

## Next Steps
- Explore adding more features, such as betting or multiple players.
- Refactor the code to improve efficiency and readability.

Happy coding!
