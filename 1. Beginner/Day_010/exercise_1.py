# Leap Year and Days in Month Exercise
# Instructions
# Write a program that works out whether if a given year is a leap year.
# A normal year has 365 days, while a leap year has 366 days. This is how you can tell the difference:
# 1. On every year that is evenly divisible by 4
# 2. If the year is evenly divisible by 100, it isn't a leap year
# 3. The year is also evenly divisible by 400. Then it is a leap year.

                return True
            else:
                return False
        else:
            return True
