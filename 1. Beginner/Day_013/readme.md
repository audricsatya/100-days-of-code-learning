# Day 13 - Beginner: Debugging

## Overview
Today, I focused on learning and practicing debugging techniques in Python. Debugging is an essential skill for identifying and fixing errors in code.

## Key Concepts
- **Debugging Basics**: Understanding error messages and stack traces.
- **Common Errors**: Syntax errors, runtime errors, and logical errors.
- **Debugging Tools**:
    - Using `print()` statements to trace code execution.
    - Python debugger (`pdb`) for step-by-step execution.
    - Debugging in an IDE (e.g., VS Code or PyCharm).

## What I Learned
- How to identify and fix common Python errors.
- The importance of testing code incrementally to catch bugs early.
- Techniques to isolate and resolve issues in complex programs.

## Challenges
- Debugging a program with multiple logical errors.
- Understanding and fixing an infinite loop caused by incorrect conditions.

## Reflection
Debugging can be frustrating, but itâ€™s a rewarding process that improves problem-solving skills. I feel more confident in tackling errors in my code.
