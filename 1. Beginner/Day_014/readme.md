# Day 14 - Higher Lower Game

## Overview
On Day 14, I worked on building a "Higher Lower" game using Python. This project focuses on comparing data and implementing game logic to create an interactive experience.

## Concepts Learned
- Using dictionaries to store and compare data.
- Implementing game loops and user input handling.
- Importing and using external data sources.
- Writing functions to modularize code.

## Features
- Compare two entities based on their attributes (e.g., follower count).
- Keep track of the user's score.
- Provide feedback for correct and incorrect guesses.
- Randomized data for replayability.

## Tools and Libraries
- Python
- Random module

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the `Day_014` folder.
3. Run the `main.py` file using Python.

## Challenges Faced
- Managing game state and ensuring proper flow.
- Handling edge cases for user input.

## Next Steps
- Add more data sources for variety.
- Improve the user interface for better engagement.
