# Day 51: Internet Speed Test & X (Twitter) Automation

## Description

On Day 51, the project focuses on automating the process of testing internet speed and posting the results directly to X (formerly Twitter). This combines network diagnostics with social media automation, providing a practical use case for selenium web scraping and automating routine tasks.

## Objective

- Measure current internet download and upload speeds automatically.
- Authenticate and connect to the X (Twitter) API.
- Post the speed test results as a tweet on the user's X account.

## Future Updates

- Schedule automatic speed tests and tweets at regular intervals.
- Add error handling and logging for failed tests or tweet attempts.
- Include graphical representations (charts) of speed history in tweets.
- Support for multiple social media platforms.
- Store historical speed data for trend analysis.
- Add notifications for significant speed drops.
- Implement a web dashboard to visualize results.
