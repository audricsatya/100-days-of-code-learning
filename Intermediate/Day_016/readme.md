# Day 16: Intermediate Python Concepts

## Topics Covered
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Classes and Objects
- Methods and Attributes
- Inheritance and Polymorphism

## Summary
On Day 16, the focus was on understanding and implementing Object-Oriented Programming in Python. Key concepts such as creating classes, defining methods, and using inheritance were explored.

## Code Example
```python
class Animal:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def speak(self):
        return f"{self.name} makes a sound."

class Dog(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        return f"{self.name} barks."

dog = Dog("Buddy")
print(dog.speak())  # Output: Buddy barks.
```

## Key Takeaways
- Classes are blueprints for creating objects.
- Methods define the behavior of objects.
- Inheritance allows a class to inherit attributes and methods from another class.
- Polymorphism enables methods to be overridden in child classes.
