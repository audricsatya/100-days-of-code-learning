# Day 23 - Intermediate Python Projects

## Overview
On Day 23, the focus is on enhancing Python programming skills by working on intermediate-level projects. This involves applying concepts like object-oriented programming, data structures, and algorithms.

## Key Concepts
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Working with external libraries
- Debugging and testing
- File handling

## Project
### Project Name: Crossing Road Game
- **Description**: A fun and interactive game where the player controls a character to cross a busy road while avoiding obstacles like moving vehicles.
- **Technologies Used**: Python, Turtle Graphics

## Goals
- Implement object-oriented programming principles.
- Use the Turtle Graphics library to create game visuals.
- Handle user input for character movement.
- Add collision detection and scoring mechanisms.

## Reflection
- **What was learned**: Improved understanding of OOP, event handling, and game development basics.
- **Challenges faced**: Managing collision detection and ensuring smooth gameplay.
- **Future improvements**: Add levels, power-ups, and a leaderboard system.
