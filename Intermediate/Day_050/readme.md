# Day 50: Tinder Automation - Swipes & Likes

## Overview

On Day 50, I explored automating Tinder interactions using Python and Selenium. The focus was on automating the process of swiping right (liking) on profiles.

## What I Did

- Set up Selenium WebDriver for browser automation.
- Logged into Tinder using Facebook/Google authentication.
- Automated the process of swiping right (like) on profiles.
- Handled pop-ups and delays to mimic human behavior.

## Key Concepts

- **Selenium WebDriver**: For browser automation.
- **XPath/CSS Selectors**: To locate swipe buttons.
- **Delays & Randomization**: To avoid detection.

## Challenges

- Handling login pop-ups and captchas.
- Avoiding detection by adding random delays.

## Next Steps

- Add logic for swiping left (dislike).
- Integrate with a database to track matches.
