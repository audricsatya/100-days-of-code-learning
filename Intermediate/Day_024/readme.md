# Day 24 - Intermediate: File Handling and Mail Merge Project

## Overview
On Day 24, we focused on learning file handling in Python and applied it to a practical project: **Mail Merge**. This project involved reading, writing, and manipulating files to automate the creation of personalized letters.

## Concepts Learned
- Reading and writing files using Python.
- Using `with open()` for file handling.
- Working with file paths and directories.
- String manipulation for dynamic content generation.

## Project: Mail Merge
The goal of the project was to create personalized letters for a list of recipients using a template file.

### Steps:
1. Read the list of names from a file.
2. Read the letter template.
3. Replace placeholders in the template with recipient names.
4. Save the personalized letters in a new folder.

### Tools Used:
- Python's `os` module for file handling.
- String replacement methods for dynamic content.

## Key Takeaways
- File handling is a powerful tool for automating repetitive tasks.
- Proper organization of file paths and directories is crucial for managing projects.
- Automating tasks like mail merge can save significant time and effort.

## Challenges
- Handling file paths dynamically for cross-platform compatibility.
- Ensuring the output files were correctly formatted and saved.

## What's Next?
Continue practicing file handling and explore more advanced Python concepts like error handling and working with external libraries.
