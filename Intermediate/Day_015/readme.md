# Day 15: Intermediate Python - Coffee Machine Project

## Overview
On Day 15, the focus is on building a Coffee Machine program using Python. This project helps reinforce concepts like functions, loops, conditionals, and dictionaries.

## Key Concepts Learned
- Using functions to structure code.
- Working with dictionaries to store data.
- Implementing loops for continuous program execution.
- Handling user input and validating it.
- Simulating a real-world machine with resources and costs.

## Project Features
- **Menu System**: Displays available coffee options and their prices.
- **Resource Management**: Tracks water, milk, and coffee supplies.
- **Coin Handling**: Accepts coins and calculates if the user has inserted enough money.
- **Transaction Processing**: Dispenses coffee if resources and payment are sufficient.
- **Admin Functionality**: Allows viewing remaining resources.

## Example Usage
```plaintext
What would you like? (espresso/latte/cappuccino): latte
Please insert coins.
How many quarters?: 4
How many dimes?: 0
How many nickels?: 0
How many pennies?: 0
Here is your latte. Enjoy!
```

## Lessons Learned
- Breaking down a problem into smaller functions improves code readability.
- Simulating real-world scenarios enhances problem-solving skills.
- Handling edge cases, such as insufficient resources or incorrect input, is crucial.

## Next Steps
- Add more features like saving data to a file or creating a GUI version.
- Explore object-oriented programming to refactor the project.
