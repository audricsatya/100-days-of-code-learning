# Day 19 - Intermediate Python: Turtle Graphics and the Etch-a-Sketch App

## Topics Covered
- Introduction to the `turtle` module.
- Drawing shapes and patterns using `turtle`.
- Building an Etch-a-Sketch app with keyboard controls.

## Key Learnings
- How to create and manipulate a `turtle` object.
- Using loops to draw complex patterns.
- Handling user input with the `turtle.listen()` method.

## Project
### Etch-a-Sketch App
- **Description**: A simple app where you can control a turtle to draw on the screen using keyboard inputs.
- **Controls**:
    - `Up`: Move forward.
    - `Down`: Move backward.
    - `Left`: Turn left.
    - `Right`: Turn right.
    - `Space`: Clear the screen.

## Reflection
Today, I learned how to use the `turtle` module to create interactive graphics. The Etch-a-Sketch app was a fun way to practice event handling and user input in Python.
