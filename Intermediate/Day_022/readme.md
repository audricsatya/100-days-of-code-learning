# Paddle Game - Day 22

## Overview
This project is part of the **100 Days of Code** challenge. On Day 22, we built a simple paddle game using Python and the `turtle` module.

## Features
- A paddle controlled by the player.
- A ball that bounces off walls and the paddle.
- Game over when the ball misses the paddle.

## Concepts Learned
- Object-oriented programming (OOP) in Python.
- Handling keyboard input with the `turtle` module.
- Collision detection and game mechanics.

## How to Run
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Run the `main.py` file in your terminal or IDE.

## Next Steps
- Add a scoring system.
- Introduce levels with increasing difficulty.
- Implement sound effects.

Happy coding!
