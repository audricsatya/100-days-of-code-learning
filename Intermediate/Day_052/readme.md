# Day 52: Instagram Follow Automation with Python

On Day 52, I explored automating the process of following users on Instagram using Python. This task involves interacting with Instagram's web interface, as their API restricts such actions.

## Tools Used

- **Selenium**: For browser automation.
- **ChromeDriver**: To control the Chrome browser.
- **time**: For delays to mimic human behavior.

## Key Steps

1. **Set up Selenium and ChromeDriver**
2. **Log in to Instagram**
3. **Navigate to a target user's followers**
4. **Automate following users**

> **Note:** Automating Instagram actions may violate their terms of service. Use responsibly and for educational purposes only.

## What I Learned

- How to use Selenium for web automation.
- The importance of adding delays to avoid detection.
- Ethical considerations and platform policies.
