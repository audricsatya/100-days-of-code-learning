# Day 55: Simple Higher or Lower Game with Flask

Today, you'll create a basic "Higher or Lower" guessing game using Flask, a lightweight Python web framework.

## Steps

1. **Set Up Flask**  
   Install Flask using pip.

2. **Create the Application**  
   Set up a Flask app that generates a random number between 1 and 100. The app should display a form where users can submit their guesses. After each guess, the app will respond with "Higher!", "Lower!", or "Correct! Refresh to play again." depending on the user's input.

3. **Run the App**  
   Start the Flask server and open the provided local URL in your browser.

4. **Play the Game**  
   Enter guesses in the browser to try and find the correct number.

**Tip:** To make the game more advanced, consider using sessions to store the random number for each user.
