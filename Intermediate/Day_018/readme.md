# Day 18 - Intermediate Python: Turtle Graphics and the Hirst Painting Project

## Overview
On Day 18, we explored the use of the `turtle` module in Python to create graphics and worked on a project to replicate a Hirst painting using code.

## Key Concepts
- **Turtle Graphics**: Using the `turtle` module to draw shapes and patterns.
- **Random Module**: Generating random colors and positions for the painting.
- **Loops**: Leveraging loops to automate repetitive drawing tasks.

## Project: Hirst Painting
The goal was to create a dot painting inspired by the works of artist Damien Hirst. This involved:
1. Setting up a grid of dots.
2. Randomizing the colors of the dots.
3. Using loops to efficiently draw the pattern.

## Reflection
This project was a fun way to practice working with Python libraries and loops. It also demonstrated how programming can be used to create art.
