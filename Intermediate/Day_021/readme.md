# Day 21 - Snake Game Part 2

## Overview
On Day 21, we continue building on the Snake game project, adding more features and refining the gameplay experience.

## Key Concepts
- Advanced game mechanics
- Collision detection
- Score tracking and game over logic
- Enhancing user experience with animations

## Project Goals
1. **Add Scoring System**: Implement a scoring mechanism to track the player's progress.
2. **Game Over Logic**: Introduce conditions for game over (e.g., collision with walls or the snake's own body).
3. **Speed Adjustment**: Increase the snake's speed as the score increases.
4. **Polish the Game**: Add visual and sound effects to improve the overall experience.

## Code Structure
- `snake.py`: Defines the `Snake` class and its behavior.
- `main.py`: Manages the main game loop and overall logic.
- `food.py`: Handles the logic for generating and managing the food items.
- `scoreboard.py`: Implements the scoring system and displays the player's score.

## Reflection
Document your progress, challenges, and learnings for Day 21.
