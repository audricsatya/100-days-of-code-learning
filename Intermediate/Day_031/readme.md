# Day 31 - Intermediate Python Projects

## Flash Card Project: Learn French to English

In this project, we will create a flash card application to help users learn French to English translations. The app will display a French word on a card, and users can flip the card to see the English translation.

### Features
- Randomly display French words with their English translations.
- Allow users to mark words they have learned.
- Save progress so users can focus on unlearned words.

### Tools and Libraries
- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **Tkinter**: For building the graphical user interface.
- **Pandas**: For handling the dataset of French-English words.

### Steps to Build
1. **Prepare the Dataset**: Use a CSV file containing French words and their English translations.
2. **Design the UI**: Create a flash card interface using Tkinter.
3. **Implement Logic**:
    - Randomly select a word from the dataset.
    - Display the French word on the front of the card.
    - Flip the card to show the English translation after a delay.
4. **Track Progress**: Save the words the user has learned to a separate file.

### Example Dataset
```csv
French,English
bonjour,hello
merci,thank you
pomme,apple
```

### Outcome
By the end of this project, you will have a functional flash card app that makes learning French vocabulary interactive and fun.
