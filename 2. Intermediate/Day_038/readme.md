# Day 38: Journaling Workout with LLM Classification & Sheets Automation

## Description

This project is a journaling workout tracker that leverages a lightweight Large Language Model (LLM) to classify workout entries and automates logging them into Google Sheets. Users can write free-form workout notes, and the LLM categorizes the activity (e.g., cardio, strength, flexibility) before sending structured data to a spreadsheet for easy tracking and analysis.

## Why Create This Project?

- **Automated Organization:** Manual workout logs can be messy. Using an LLM for classification helps keep records organized without extra effort.
- **Data-Driven Progress:** Storing workouts in Google Sheets enables visualization, progress tracking, and data analysis.
- **Hands-Off Logging:** Automation reduces repetitive data entry, making it easier to maintain consistency in journaling.

## What to Improve

- **Model Accuracy:** Enhance the LLM's ability to classify diverse workout descriptions.
- **User Interface:** Build a simple web or mobile UI for easier input.
- **Integration:** Add support for other fitness platforms or export formats.
- **Analytics:** Implement charts and summaries directly in the sheet or via a dashboard.
- **Privacy:** Ensure user data is handled securely and privately.
