# Day 56: Website with Flask and Template

## Project Overview

On Day 56, you'll create a simple website using Flask and a template. This exercise will help you understand how to structure a Flask project, use HTML templates, apply CSS, and organize your project files.

---

## Folder Structure

Your project should include:

- An `app.py` file for your Flask application.
- A `templates/` folder containing your `index.html` (and any other HTML files).
- A `static/css/` folder for your `style.css`.
- A `static/images/` folder for any assets you want to use.

For this exercise, use a free HTML5UP template as the starting point for your website. Download your chosen template from [html5up.net](https://html5up.net/) and copy its files into the appropriate folders in your Flask project.

## Instructions

1. **Set Up Flask:**  
   Install Flask with `pip install flask` if you haven't already.

2. **Choose a Template:**  
   Visit [html5up.net](https://html5up.net/) and select a free template you like.

3. **Download and Organize:**  
   Download the template and move its HTML files to the `templates/` folder, CSS files to `static/css/`, and images to `static/images/`.

4. **Create Your Flask App:**  
   Set up your Flask application to render your chosen template.

5. **Customize:**

   - Edit `templates/index.html` to personalize the content.
   - Modify `static/css/style.css` to change styles as needed.
   - Replace images in `static/images/` with your own.

6. **Test Locally:**  
   Run your Flask app and open it in your browser to see your changes.

7. **Document Your Work:**  
   Update this `README.md` with notes about your customizations and what you learned.

## Tips

- Keep your folder structure organized.
- Make small changes and refresh your browser to see the results.
- Refer to the template's documentation for additional features.
- Use Flask's static and template features to manage your assets.
