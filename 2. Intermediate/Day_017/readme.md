# Day 17: Intermediate Python Concepts

## Topics Covered
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Classes and Objects
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
- Encapsulation

## Summary
Today, I delved deeper into Object-Oriented Programming in Python. I explored how to create and use classes, implement inheritance, and apply polymorphism. Additionally, I learned about encapsulation and how it helps in restricting access to certain components of an object.

## Project: Quiz Application

### Description
As part of today's learning, I worked on a Quiz Application project to apply the concepts of Object-Oriented Programming. The project involved creating classes to represent questions and the quiz itself, implementing methods to manage the quiz flow, and ensuring encapsulation of data.

### Key Features
- A `Question` class to encapsulate question text and answer.
- A `Quiz` class to manage the list of questions, track the score, and handle user interaction.
- Use of inheritance to extend functionality if needed in the future.
- Polymorphism to handle different types of questions or quizzes.

### Lessons Learned
- How to design and structure a project using OOP principles.
- The importance of encapsulation in maintaining clean and modular code.
- Practical implementation of inheritance and polymorphism in real-world scenarios.
- Debugging and testing OOP-based applications.

### Next Steps
- Add more question types (e.g., multiple-choice, true/false).
- Implement a graphical user interface (GUI) for the quiz.
- Explore saving and loading quiz data using files or databases.
