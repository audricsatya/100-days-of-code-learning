# Day 20 - Intermediate Python: Snake Game Part 1

## Overview
On Day 20, we started building the Snake Game using Python and the Turtle module. The focus was on creating the basic structure of the game and implementing the initial functionality.

## Key Concepts Learned
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python
- Creating and managing classes
- Handling keyboard input with the `turtle` module

## Features Implemented
1. **Snake Movement**: 
    - Created a `Snake` class to manage the snake's body and movement.
    - Implemented methods for moving the snake and changing its direction.

## Code Structure
- `snake.py`: Contains the `Snake` class.
- `main.py`: The main game loop and logic.

## Challenges
- Managing the snake's movement and ensuring smooth gameplay.

## Next Steps
- Add food to the game to allow the snake to grow.
- Implement collision detection for walls and the snake's body.
