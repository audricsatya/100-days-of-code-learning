## Day 47: Amazon Price Tracker

Today, I built a simple Amazon price tracker. The script checks the price of a product on Amazon and sends me an email if the price drops below my specified budget.

**Key steps:**

- Used `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` to scrape the product price.
- Compared the current price with my budget.
- Sent an email notification using `smtplib` if the price was right.

This project helped me practice web scraping, working with APIs, and automating email notifications in Python.
