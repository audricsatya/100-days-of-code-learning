# Day 59: Created Blog with Bootstrap and Jinja

Today, I created a blog application using a template powered by **Bootstrap** for styling and **Jinja** for templating. This setup allows for dynamic content rendering and a responsive, modern UI.

**Key highlights:**

- Integrated Bootstrap for layout and components.
- Used Jinja templating to render blog posts dynamically.
- Set up basic blog structure with home, post, and about pages.

_Progressing further with Flask and web development!_
